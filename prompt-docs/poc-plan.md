## Monitoring During PoC

### Metrics to Track

- Goroutine counts
- Error rates and types

### Logging Requirements
```yaml
log_categories:
  authentication:
    - AD bind attempts
    - User validation results
    - Session creation/destruction
  ssh:
    - Connection attempts
    - Command execution
    - Connection pool events
  security:
    - Credential encryption/decryption events
    - Failed authentication attempts
    - Session timeout events
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **AD Connectivity Issues**
   - Mitigation: Test with multiple AD servers
   - Fallback: Consider LDAPS vs LDAP+TLS

2. **SSH Library Limitations**
   - Mitigation: Test golang.org/x/crypto/ssh thoroughly
   - Fallback: Consider gliderlabs/ssh or other libraries

3. **Memory Leaks with Credentials**
   - Mitigation: Use Go's `defer` for cleanup
   - Validation: Memory profiling with pprof

4. **TACACS+ Compatibility**
   - Mitigation: Test with multiple TACACS+ implementations
   - Fallback: Build abstraction layer for different servers
